    <content>Rewrote much of the code for the mod.

Added mod-options to select when pawns shall pick up a weapon. The basic level is just to pick up a weapon if they do not have one equipped. The mod can also make Brawlers and Hunters replace their weapon if it is of the wrong type. 
Lastly the max-setting all pawns will replace their weapon if they can find a better one.
All weapons are added to outfits so you can use this to limit what weapons pawns should look for.

There is also support for Simple Sidearms in that the mod will use the lowest setting if the Simple Sidearms-mod is loaded. This should stop pawns from wrongly picking up multiple weapons.
